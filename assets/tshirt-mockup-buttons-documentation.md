## ‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript Functionality

### State Management
```javascript
const mockup = {
  state: { view: "front", color: "white" },
  placementState: {
    topPct: 30,
    leftPct: 50,
    widthPct: 50,
    heightPct: 65,
    rotateDeg: 0,
    hasUploadedDesign: false,
    designSelected: false
  }
};
```

### Event Handling
- View button clicks update `state.view` and call `updateBase()`
- Color button clicks update `state.color` and call `updateBase()`
- Upload button triggers file input and processes uploaded images
- 3D control buttons manipulate `placementState` values
- Action buttons trigger specific functionality (download, submit, etc.)

### File Upload
- Accepts PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG files
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Converts to base64 data URL
- Applies to mockup overlay with proper scaling

### Drag & Drop
- Mouse-based dragging of uploaded designs
- Real-time position updates
- Constrained to canvas bounds
- Visual feedback with cursor changes

### Perfect Fit Algorithm
```javascript
const perfectDimensions = {
  topPct: 29.142857142856876,
  leftPct: 50.21428571428568,
  widthPct: 37,
  heightPct: 42,
  rotateDeg: 0
};
```

### Download Functionality
- Creates high-resolution composite canvas (2x scale)
- Draws base t-shirt image
- Overlays uploaded design with current position/size/rotation
- Downloads as PNG file with timestamp
