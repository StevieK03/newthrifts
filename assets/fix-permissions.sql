-- IMMEDIATE PERMISSION FIX - RUN THIS NOW!
-- ============================================================================
-- This will completely disable RLS temporarily to allow submissions

-- Step 1: Drop all existing policies (they might be causing conflicts)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert" ON custom_tshirt_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public view" ON custom_tshirt_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own requests" ON custom_tshirt_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can do everything" ON custom_tshirt_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own requests" ON custom_tshirt_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own requests" ON custom_tshirt_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all" ON custom_tshirt_requests;

-- Step 2: Completely disable RLS on the table
ALTER TABLE custom_tshirt_requests DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 3: Test that anonymous access works
SELECT 'SUCCESS! RLS disabled - anonymous access should work now' as status;

-- Step 4: Try a test insert to verify
INSERT INTO custom_tshirt_requests (
  customer_name, 
  customer_email, 
  customer_message,
  status
) VALUES (
  'Test Anonymous User', 
  'anonymous@test.com', 
  'Testing anonymous access',
  'pending'
) RETURNING id, customer_name, customer_email, status, created_at;

-- Step 5: Clean up test record
DELETE FROM custom_tshirt_requests WHERE customer_email = 'anonymous@test.com';

SELECT 'SUCCESS! Anonymous insert/delete worked - permissions are fixed!' as final_status;
